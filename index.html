            I am a junior front-end developer looking to start his career in web development. Being a developer is a passion
            to me, as I enjoy solving problems and writing sophisticated algorithms. Working as an economist, I found out
            that I'd like a job where I would be able to apply my creative skills, designing something beautiful in process.
            Coding works perfectly for me, as I find great satisfaction in balancing speed of my algorithms and readibility of my code.
          </p>

            Being a junior developer, I strive to learn something new every day. It takes a lot of work to stay competitive in an
            ever-changing tech world, and I do my best to keep up with new technologies. Thankfully, internet today is filled with
            great content covering almost every detail of programming languages and frameworks. Sometimes I wish I had more time
            to study <b>everything</b>, but I realise it takes more than a lifetime to do that. Nevertheless, I constantly find
            myself spending my time and money on new tech related courses, that cover that awesome framework or library I wanted
            to learn for a long time.
